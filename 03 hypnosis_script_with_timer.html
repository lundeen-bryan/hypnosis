              Some people find it easy to begin hypnosis by simply looking up,
              just a little higher, as if toward the eyebrows. And as the eyes
              look upward, there's often a gentle feeling of strain in the
              eyelids... maybe even behind the eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you begin to feel that gentle strain on your eyes, that's
              just a sign for you to naturally allow your eyes to close now. and
              when you’re ready, to open them again.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once more, looking upward... feeling that familiar sense
              returning... letting the eyelids close a little more slowly this
              time.
            </p>
            <p>
              ...and then, as your eyes open again, this time, let the natural
              response happen all by itself.

              And as those eyelids settle down, you might find that they remain
              comfortably closed… and every time you repeat that movement, they
              close even more easily… until they simply prefer to stay closed…
              allowing you to go deeper and deeper inside.
            </p>
            <p>
              And in a moment, but not yet, I’m going to ask you to gently test
              your eyelids to see if they might want to open, but you’re going
              to find that they juuussst don’t want to open. You can try to test
              them now. That’s right. Then allow your eyelids to relax. You can
              stop testing.

              And isn’t it interesting how, the very moment our eyes remain
              closed, your attention is automatically drawn inward… as though
              the world outside simply fades, and what matters most is the
              comfort within.
            </p>
            <p>
              And any sounds you may hear, or any interruptions or distractions
              that might occur, can simply be used by your mind as gentle
              reminders to bring your attention back inward… just as it is now…
              so that all you really need to notice is the sound of my voice
              guiding you deeper.

              And as those eyelids rest so comfortably now... you can begin to
              drift even deeper, guided by your imagination...
            </p>
            <p>
              In a moment, you can begin a gentle descent into a deeper comfort.
              We'll go down through three levels - A, B, and C.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each time you descend to the next level, you can drift twice as
              deep and feel twice as comfortable.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a moment, but not yet, I'll count from 1 to 3. On 3, you can
              imagine stepping onto a gentle escalator and begin an easy descent
              to Level A.
            </p>
            <p>
              1...2...3... stepping onto the escalator now... letting it move by
              itself... carrying you down easily and comfortably... and when you
              arrive at Level A, you can take a deep breath and say the letter
              “A” out loud.
            </p>
            <p>
              Good... and in a moment, but not yet... you can move from Level A
              down to Level B. As you descend, your comfort can easily double,
              twice as deep, twice as calm as you are right now.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ll count from 1 to 3, and on 3, you can drift down to Level B,
              twice as calm and twice as relaxed as before. 1… 2… 3… drifting
              down now… deeper and deeper… the escalator carrying you easily and
              comfortably, all the way to Level B. When you arrive, take a deep
              breath and say the letter ‘B’ out loud.
            </p>
            <p>
              Excellent. You're doing very well. There's just one more level
              left, Level C, which is twice as deep as you are right now. By the
              time you reach it, you can be more calm and relaxed than you've
              ever been before. In a moment, I’ll count from 1 to 3. On 3, you
              can drift down to Level C, even more calm and even more relaxed as
              before. Don’t try to help it along, just let it happen.
            </p>
            <p>
              And as you prepare to move from Level B down to Level C, you may
              find that by the time you reach the last level... your vocal cords
              will be soooooo relaxed that it may be difficult to say the letter
              ‘C’ <br />
              — but try to say it anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
              1… 2… 3… drifting down now… deeper and deeper… the escalator
              carrying you easily and comfortably, all the way to Level C.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you arrive, take a deep breath and try to say the letter ‘C’
              out loud, noticing how good it feels to rest there for a moment,
              completely calm and deeply relaxed.

              disappeared. You know there’s a number between 5 and 7, but it
