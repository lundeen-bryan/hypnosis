SECTION: Modified Spiegel Eye Roll Induction + Escalator Deepener
Pre-frame:

In a moment, I’ll ask you to open and close your eyes a few times. Each time you close them, it’s simply another chance to relax even more deeply and comfortably. Until I say the word CLOSE, just keep your eyes open and comfortable, noticing what you see and what you feel. When I say CLOSE, that’s when you let them close. Is that okay?

Some people find it easy to begin hypnosis by simply looking up, that’s right… just a little higher, as if you’re looking at your eyebrows, so that the eyes begin to notice a gentle strain in the eyelids, and perhaps even behind the eyes.

And as those eyelids feel the strain of looking just a little too high… you might already feel how natural it could be to let them close down now… just for a moment… and then, when you’re ready, to open them again.

(pause while they open their eyes again)

And once more, looking upward again… noticing how familiar that feeling is becoming… and perhaps this time, you you could let them drift down even more slowly than before… as if the effort simply melts away with each gentle blink... You can allow your eyelids to close.

(pause, allow them to close slowly, then continue)

Good… and then once again, as your eyes open… drifting upward toward those eyebrows… the very moment you notice that strain… you can allow the natural response to happen all by itself… and this time, it may feel as though the eyes simply want to close… all on their own… as though your unconscious mind already knows how good it feels to just let go.

And as those eyelids settle down, you might find that they remain comfortably closed… and every time you repeat that movement, they close even more easily… until they simply prefer to stay closed… allowing you to go deeper and deeper inside.

And in a moment, but not yet, I’m going to ask you to gently test your eyelids to see if they might want to open but you’re going to find that they juuussst don’t want to open. You can try to test them now. That’s right. Then allow your eyelids to relax.

And isn’t it interesting how, the very moment our eyes remain closed, your attention is automatically drawn inward… as though the world outside simply fades, and what matters most is the comfort within.

And any sounds you may hear, or any interruptions or distractions that might occur, can simply be used by your mind as gentle reminders to bring your attention back inward… just as it is now… so that all you really need to notice is the sound of my voice guiding you deeper.

And as those eyelids rest so comfortably now… you may find yourself ready to go even deeper, with the help of your imagination…

SUBSECTION: Spiegel Escalator Deepener

In a moment, you may allow yourself to begin a gradual descent into even more comfortable relaxation. To get there, I’ll ask you to go down three deeper levels of relaxation. Let’s call these levels A, B, and C.

Each time I count from one to three, your relaxation can easily double — twice as deep, twice as calm — as you move to the next level down.

And in a moment, I’ll count from 1 to 3, and on 3, you can imagine yourself stepping onto that gentle escalator, beginning your comfortable descent to Level A.

1… 2… 3… — stepping onto that smooth escalator now, letting it carry you down… effortlessly… comfortably. And as you ride it downward, you can go twice as deep as you were before, all you need to do is double your relaxation that you’re experiencing right now.

When you arrive at Level A, let me know by taking in a deep breath, and saying the letter “A” out loud.
(pause for response)

Good. Now I’m going to count from 1 to 3. On the count of 3, the escalator will take you from Level A down to Level B, and your relaxation will double again, twice as deep as before.

If you follow my instructions, by the time you get to Level B your vocal cords will be so relaxed it will be very difficult to say ‘B’ – but try to say it anyway. When you arrive at Level B, let me know by taking in a deep breath, and saying the letter “B” out loud.

1… 2… 3… — going down now… deeper… and deeper… And as you ride it downward, you can go twice as deep as you were before, all you need to do is double your relaxation that you’re experiencing right now.

(pause for response)

Excellent. You’re doing very well. There’s just one more level left — Level C, the very bottom of relaxation, where you’ll feel absolutely amazing.

I’ll count from 1 to 3 once more, and on 3, the escalator will take you all the way down to the deepest level of relaxation, Level C. Don’t try to help it along, just let it happen.

1… 2… 3… — going down to Level C… the very bottom of your relaxation… deeper… deeper… deeper… down… down… down… And as you ride it downward, you can go twice as deep as you were before, all you need to do is double your relaxation that you’re experiencing right now.

CONVINCER: Number Forget Convincer

Under hypnosis, you can speak to me if I ask you to. In a moment, I am going to count from 1 to 3, and by the time I reach the number 3, you will forget the number 6 completely. The number 6 will be gone from your mind, as though it never existed for now.

When I ask you to count from 1 to 10, you’ll find that the only way you can count is this way: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10. You’ll do it automatically and easily, without even noticing anything unusual—until I bring it to your attention. Then, I’ll ask you to count backward from 10 to 1, and you’ll find the same thing happens: 10, 9, 8, 7, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

Good. Now, count from 1 to 10, please.
(pause for subject to respond)

That’s right. Even when I awaken you, the only way you can manage numbers is the way you just did, until I snap my fingers twice. When I snap my fingers twice, you’ll be able to go back to your original mode of counting easily and naturally.

Now, please count again from 1 to 10.
(pause for subject to respond)

That’s right. Very good.

From this point forward, you may notice that any time you take a deep, comfortable breath, your body remembers how to return to this deep, peaceful state quickly and easily.

SECTION: Bridge to Suggestions
And now that you’re settled so comfortably… your mind can begin to take in ideas that are helpful and useful for you. You don’t even have to do anything—just notice that the thoughts and words that are good for you can gently settle in, while everything else simply drifts away.

In a moment, I’ll begin offering you some helpful suggestions—simple ideas that your mind can absorb easily, in whatever way feels right to you.

So as you continue breathing comfortably, these ideas can become a natural part of you…

All of these ideas can continue to grow stronger with every breath, every time you practice, every time you think about hypnosis.

(See Suggestion Menu)

SECTION: Positive Awakening

…And very soon now, you’ll be ready to awaken fully from this experience. When you do, you’ll find yourself feeling alert, refreshed, and wonderfully positive about life. It’s as if the calm and ease you’ve experienced here today stays with you, while you wake up feeling brighter, lighter, and happier than before.

In a moment, I’ll count from one to five. With each number, you return more fully to the present, carrying with you that good feeling, that confidence, that positive energy.

One… slowly returning now.
Two… feeling refreshed.
Three… energy flowing back into your body.
Four… eyes beginning to feel lighter.
Five… eyes open, wide awake, alert, and feeling happy about this session.”
