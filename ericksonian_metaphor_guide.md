### How to Create Ericksonian Metaphors

**Step 1. Clarify the purpose.**  
Decide the change or insight you want to evoke.

**Step 2. Choose the emotional theme (or desired state).**  
Identify the feeling or internal state you want to evoke—such as courage, curiosity, or acceptance.

**Step 3. Find a natural situation or story that expresses that theme.**  
Select something relatable and concrete—a moment in nature, a personal anecdote, or a simple observation.

**Step 4. Describe the experience vividly.**  
Use sensory-rich and emotionally textured language. Allow the listener to sense the state rather than be told its meaning.

**Step 5. Maintain ambiguity.**  
Keep the story open to interpretation. Avoid moralizing or labeling the meaning. Let the unconscious find the connection.

**Step 6. Embed suggestions naturally.**  
Include indirect suggestions and permissive phrasing that imply change without demanding it.

**Step 7. Resolve or leave open with possibility.**  
End the story in a way that conveys movement, growth, or quiet resolution—without analyzing or explaining it.

**Step 8. (Optional) Refer back indirectly later.**  
You may casually reference the story again to reinforce the lesson without directly interpreting it.

### FAQ: Applying the Steps

**Q1. Is an emotional theme the same as an NLP state?**  
Yes, mostly. An emotional theme corresponds to a state in NLP—a specific way of being or feeling (e.g., confidence, calm curiosity). The metaphor aims to evoke that state indirectly.

**Q2. Should we include submodalities when describing the story?**  
Yes, subtly. Describe sensory qualities (brightness, distance, tone, texture) to evoke the feeling state. Keep it natural—don’t overload the metaphor with technical submodality shifts.

**Q3. What if the listener doesn’t understand the story?**  
That’s normal. Metaphors often work below conscious understanding. In a practice or learning setting, it’s fine to ask what emotional state the teller intended, but not to decode the “meaning.”

**Q4. Should we use Ericksonian language patterns?**  
Yes—but weave them subtly. Use pacing, permissive suggestions (\"you may find...\"), and embedded commands sparingly. Too much structure can feel artificial.

**Q5. How should a metaphor end?**  
*Do:* End with a sense of natural completion or gentle movement toward possibility (e.g., \"And somewhere, the seed began to reach toward the light.\").  
*Don’t:* Explain what the story means, or stare expectantly as if waiting for an instant reaction.

**Q6. Doesn’t referring back to the metaphor reveal its meaning?**  
Not if done lightly. Say something like, \"It’s a bit like that story of the seed,\" and move on. You’re reactivating the metaphor without dissecting it. The meaning remains implicit.

### Giving Feedback on Metaphors in Practice

**1. Listen for feeling and rhythm, not logic.**  
Metaphors are meant to *evoke*, not *explain.* Focus on how the story made you feel, what images it created, or what emotions it stirred. Share that experience first.

**2. Ask about intention, not interpretation.**  
In a training or feedback setting, it’s appropriate to ask, “What state or outcome were you aiming to create with this story?” This helps you understand their purpose without forcing an explicit meaning.

**3. Describe the impact, not the analysis.**  
Say things like, “That story felt peaceful and spacious,” or “It left me curious about what might happen next,” rather than “I think it means X.” Feedback should reflect your inner response, not an attempt to decode.

**4. Clarify confusion gently.**  
If the metaphor makes no sense, you can say, “I’m curious what effect you wanted to create,” instead of “That made no sense.” This keeps discussion constructive.

**5. Private explanation is fine for learning.**  
Like Jesus explaining parables to his close followers, partners in a learning setting can absolutely discuss meaning afterward. The key is timing—the meaning is revealed only after the listener has already experienced the metaphor fully and given their honest reaction first.

**6. Remember the goal.**  
Feedback in Ericksonian metaphor practice isn’t about right or wrong meanings—it’s about refining how well the story evokes a desired *state* or *emotional movement.*
