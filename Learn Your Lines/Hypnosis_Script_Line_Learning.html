                close later, but each blink seems to be slower and slower as if

                for you to close your eyes too, but if you do, you can

                And as those eyelids settle down, you might find that they
                remain comfortably closed… and every time you repeat that
                movement, they close even more easily… until they simply prefer

                </p>

                <p>
                  You might find that they stay comfortably closed… or they may
                  open for a moment, before closing again and you become even

                </p>

                <p>

                  more easily they prefer to stay closed.

                <p>
                  You can try to test them now… that’s right… and then simply
                  let them relax completely… and enjoy that gentle comfort.

                  <em>
                    That’s right… when your eyes open, it simply gives you the
                    chance to close them again and drift even deeper into that
                    comfortable state of relaxation. You can imagine the tiny
                    muscles around your eyes becoming twice as relaxed as
                    before… just by gently closing them a little tighter for a
                    moment… and then allowing them to loosen, soften, and relax
                    completely again… feeling that ease spreading even more
                    deeply through your whole body now.

                I once heard about someone who discovered a very simple way to
                go deeper into relaxation. On a quiet afternoon, in one of those
                modern buildings with tall glass windows that let in soft light.
                They found themselves standing on the third floor, and in the
                distance they could see an escalator that moved slowly downward.
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="line">
              <div class="idx">V.3</div>
              <div>
                When they got closer they could see this was a nice shiny brand
                new and clean escalator. They stepped onto the gentle escalator
                and it took them down silently and the speed at which it moved
                downward, is the speed at which your mind wants to go deeper into
                relaxation.
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="line">
              <div class="idx">V.4</div>
              <div>
                And in your mind's eye when you see that they have reached the
                next level and they are twice as relaxed as before you can give
                me a gentle nod.

              <div class="idx">V.5</div>
              <div>
                And then they noticed another escalator going down to the next
                level of relaxation, going twice as deep as they were before.
              </div>
            </div>

              <div class="idx">V.6</div>
              <div>
                And as they stepped onto the escalator, it relaxed every muscle
                in their body as they went down... down... to the next level of
                relaxation and the speed at which it moved downward, is the speed at
                which your mind wants to go deeper into relaxation.

              <div class="idx">V.8</div>
              <div>
                And finally, they come to another escalator, and this one has a
                sign that says, 'Deepest Level Below' and this escalator takes
                them twice as deep and twice as relaxed.

              <div class="idx">V.9</div>
              <div>
                And then they step onto this escalator and it takes them deeper
                than they've ever been before into the deepest level of
                relaxation. and the speed at which it moved downward, is the speed at
                which your mind wants to go deeper into relaxation.

              <div>
                And in your mind's eye, when you see that they have reached the
                last level and they are twice as relaxed as they've ever been
                before, try to give me a gentle nod if you can.

              <div>
                And when you notice that they have reached the last level, there
                is a mirror on the wall as they step down. And in that mirror
                image, you can see your reflection as you step off of the
                escalator. And you can notice that all the relaxation that you
                imagined they experienced was your relaxation.
