          These questions gently <em>utilize</em> the subject’s natural responses to deepen trance—
          especially when they are hovering near trance but not quite there yet.
          Use the Eye Closure set to focus attention and comfort, and the Arm Levitation set to invite automatic movement.

        <h2 id="eyes">I. Eye Closure Deepening Questions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Have you ever been in a trance before… right now?
            <div class="note">If “no,” then ask: <em>“What is the relationship between the state you are in right now, and the state you were in just before you woke up this morning?”</em></div>
          </li>
          <li>Did you experience that state as being similar to the waking state, or different from the waking state?</li>
          <li>Can you find a spot that you would like to look at comfortably?</li>
          <li>As you continue comfortably looking at that spot for a while, do your eyelids want to blink?</li>
          <li>Will those lids begin to blink one at a time… twice or three times before they close altogether?</li>
          <li>Rapidly or more slowly?</li>
          <li>Will they just close now, or will they flutter all by themselves first?</li>
          <li>Will the eyes close more and more as you get more and more relaxed?</li>
          <li>That’s right. Can those eyes just stay closed as your comfort… able to go deeper, just like when you go to sleep?</li>
          <li>Can your comfort go more and more deeply, inside, so that you’d rather not even try to open your eyes?</li>
          <li>Or would you rather really try in vain and find you cannot?</li>
          <li>And just when will you soon forget about them altogether because your unconscious… wants you to dream!</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="arms">
        <h2 id="arms">II. Arm Levitation Deepening Questions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Have you ever been in a trance before… right now?
            <div class="note">If “no,” then ask: <em>“What is the relationship between the state you are in right now, and the state you were in just before you woke up this morning?”</em></div>
          </li>
          <li>Did you experience that state as being similar to the waking state, or different from the waking state?</li>
          <li>You can feel comfortable resting your hands gently on your thighs, can you not? (Demonstrate.) That’s right, don’t let them touch each other.</li>
          <li>Can you let those hands rest sooo lightly so that the tips just touch your thighs?</li>
          <li>Can you make sure the hands and fingertips barely touch the thighs?</li>
          <li>That’s right. As they rest there just so lightly, have you noticed yet how they tend to lift up a bit all by themselves (Hypnotherapist take a deep breath here) with each breath you take? Good. Now we will just wait and see.</li>
          <li>Now, can you find a spot that you would like to look at comfortably?</li>
          <li>As you continue comfortably looking at that spot for a while, do your eyelids want to blink?</li>
          <li>Will those lids begin to blink one at a time… twice or three times before they close altogether?</li>
          <li>Rapidly or more slowly?</li>
          <li>Will they just close now, or will they flutter all by themselves first?</li>
          <li>Will the eyes close more and more as you get more and more relaxed?</li>
          <li>That’s right. Can those eyes just stay closed as your comfort… able to go deeper, just like when you go to sleep?</li>
          <li>Can your comfort go more and more deeply, inside, so that you’d rather not even try to open your eyes?</li>
          <li>Or would you rather really try in vain and find you cannot?</li>
          <li>And just when will you soon forget about them altogether because your unconscious… wants you to dream! … of lifting, lifting, lifting.</li>
          <li>Have you noticed your hands lifting, lifting, lifting even more lightly, even more easily… and by themselves as the rest of your body relaxes more and more?</li>
          <li>And as you do, does one of the hands or the other or maybe both continue lifting, lifting, lifting even more?</li>
          <li>And does the hand stay up and continue lifting, lifting, lifting even higher and higher and higher, all by itself? Does the other hand want to catch up and go up too, or will the other hand just relax in your lap?</li>
          <li>That’s right. And does the hand continue lifting, lifting, lifting as it is, or will the lifting get smoother or less smooth as the hand continues upward toward your face?</li>
          <li>Now… does it slow down, or go faster and faster as it approaches your face, deepening your comfort? Will it… pause a bit before it touches your face so you’ll know you are really going into a trance? And it won’t touch until your Unconscious… is really, really ready to let you go deeper… will it!</li>
          <li>And… will your body automatically take a deeper breath when that hand just touches your face and you automatically relax and experience yourself going deeper and deeper?</li>
          <li>That’s right. Perhaps you won’t even bother to notice your deepening comfort as that hand slowly goes back to your lap all by itself? Perhaps your unconscious… will be in a dream by the time that hand really comes to rest?</li>
