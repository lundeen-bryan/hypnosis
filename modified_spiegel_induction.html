  <div class="block">
    <h2>Pretalk / Setup</h2>
    <p>"Hypnosis is simply a way of focusing your attention inward.<br>
    All you need to do is follow a few simple steps and notice what happens."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <h2>Step 1: Eye Roll</h2>
    <p>"Without moving your head, look upward — as though you’re trying to see your own eyebrows or the ceiling above you."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <h2>Step 2: Noticing Strain</h2>
    <p>"Notice the gentle strain in your eyelids and forehead…<br>
    and the longer you keep them up, the heavier they begin to feel…<br>
    almost as if they just want to close all by themselves."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <h2>Step 3: Natural Closure</h2>
    <p>"And sometimes, when we close our eyes,<br>
    it feels completely natural to go inside…<br>
    to shift your attention inward."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <h2>Step 4: Allowing Closure</h2>
    <p>"So whenever you’re ready, you can just allow your eyelids to close down now…<br>
    and as they do, you can follow that natural pull inside,<br>
    deeper and more comfortably with each breath."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <h2>Step 5: Deepening</h2>
    <p>"That’s right…<br>
    with each easy breath, letting go a little more…<br>
    enjoying the comfort that grows as you drift inward."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <h2>Step 6: Session Work</h2>
    <p>[Proceed with suggestions, imagery, or therapeutic process.]</p>
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <h2>Step 7: Emerging</h2>
    <p>"In a moment, I’ll count from 1 up to 5.<br>
    With each number, you’ll return to full alertness —<br>
    1, feeling energy return…<br>
    2, becoming more aware of the room…<br>
    3, breathing deeply, feeling refreshed…<br>
    4, eyes ready to open…<br>
    and 5, eyes open now, wide awake, alert, and feeling good."</p>
