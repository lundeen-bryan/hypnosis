### Unconscious Learning from Euphoria — Script (in Martijn’s style)

> And maybe there have been moments in your life when you felt something really good…
> a sense of euphoria, or deep love, or completeness…
> where everything just felt right, as if life itself was flowing through you.
>
> You don’t even have to remember when or where —
> only that somewhere inside, your unconscious knows what that feels like.
>
> And in hypnosis, we can let that part of you…
> review those moments…
> learn from them…
> and even teach you how to be more like that again.
>
> Because your unconscious mind knows how to take what’s positive and useful,
> and bring more of that into the present.
>
> So as you begin to relax… you can just allow your unconscious to do what it does best —
> to learn, to restore, and to remind you of who you really are when you feel good inside.
