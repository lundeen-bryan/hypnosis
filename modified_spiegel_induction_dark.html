      <h2>Pretalk / Setup</h2>
      <p class="big">"Hypnosis is simply a way of focusing your attention inward.<br>
      All you need to do is follow a few simple steps and notice what happens."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <h2>Step 1: Eye Roll</h2>
      <p class="big">"Without moving your head, look upward — as though you’re trying to see your own eyebrows or the ceiling above you."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <h2>Step 2: Noticing Strain</h2>
      <p class="big">"Notice the gentle strain in your eyelids and forehead…<br>
      and the longer you keep them up, the heavier they begin to feel…<br>
      almost as if they just want to close all by themselves."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <h2>Step 3: Natural Closure</h2>
      <p class="big">"And sometimes, when we close our eyes,<br>
      it feels completely natural to go inside…<br>
      to shift your attention inward."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <h2>Step 4: Allowing Closure</h2>
      <p class="big">"So whenever you’re ready, you can just allow your eyelids to close down now…<br>
      and as they do, you can follow that natural pull inside,<br>
      deeper and more comfortably with each breath."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <h2>Step 5: Deepening</h2>
      <p class="big">"That’s right…<br>
      with each easy breath, letting go a little more…<br>
      enjoying the comfort that grows as you drift inward."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <h2>Step 6: Session Work</h2>
      <p class="big">[Proceed with suggestions, imagery, or therapeutic process.]</p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <h2>Step 7: Emerging</h2>
      <p class="big">"In a moment, I’ll count from 1 up to 5.<br>
      With each number, you’ll return to full alertness —<br>
      1, feeling energy return…<br>
      2, becoming more aware of the room…<br>
      3, breathing deeply, feeling refreshed…<br>
      4, eyes ready to open…<br>
      and 5, eyes open now, wide awake, alert, and feeling good."</p>
