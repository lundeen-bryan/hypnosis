# MEMENTO MORI

I like to collect quotes and place them on the wall and (pause as you stretch up on the wall
and pull down the plaque)... They're nice little conversation starters sometims to introduce a
story... I have a quote here from Marcus Aurelius, an ancient roman philosopher, that says,
"Memento Mori" and this one reminds me of something that everyone should consider. Now, (pause
while you take a big swollow before starting the next story) One of my favorite hypnotists is
named Marczell Klein and he tells a story of when he was a kid and he really loved his dogs.
But one day while he was at school his father called him and said, "Sorry son, but both your
dogs died... and hung up the phone." He was shocked and confused and when he got home the two
small dogs were just laying on the side of the road and he was told to go get a garbage bag,
put them in it, and put the bag in the garbage. He was heart broken and he tried to imagine
that the dogs where in a better place but they were gone. Those bodies that he looked at were
not his dogs that he was crying for.

And it reminded me of a dog I once had when I was about 7 or 8 named Tiffany. And I was one of
those weirdo kids that loved to hug and lean on my dog. So everyday before I went to school I
would hug her and lean on her and she was so good to me that she just let me do it. But she
wasn't so nice with other people. Like she snaped at my dad and whenever my brother and I
played with her she would knock him over into the mud and I would just laugh at him. But one
day I came home from school and Tiffany had been returned to the breeder because my parents
thought she was too difficult to deal with and I was a pretty tough kid at 8 so I never cried
about anything, but I did cry at loosing my dog. I went to my mom's room and layed my head in
her lap and cried and she cried which was in a way a bonding experience for us.

But years later when my dad passed away my mom wasn't really that strong to get through it so I
made all the arrangements for the funeral and the wake and making a big speech about how nice
my dad was and how everyone liked him. And we got through that but it shows you how short life
is and how time just goes by so quickly (short pause here as if lost in thought or imagination)
and it brings me back to the quote from Marcus Aurilius on my wall that says "memento mori"
(pause again but this time hang the plaque back up on the wall which allows their mind to pause)
which if translated to english means essentially we all must die someday.

What if today was the last day you had to accomplish your goals? what if the only time you had to
accomplish that one thing you'd always wanted to do was today?

Imagine what things you could acomplish if you lived as if you only had today to do it? maybe
you'd tell someone you loved them, maybe you would put all your effort into becoming the best
hypnotist in the world, maybe you'd go sell a million widgets to Google or something... but we
all must die and we all must consider that we only really have right now to go do what you've
always wanted to do.
