# Sleeping Beauty
### A Retelling with the Sleeping Kingdom and the Wicked Witch

Long ago, in a prosperous kingdom, a king and queen were blessed with a daughter after many years of waiting. Their joy was so great that they invited all the fairies of the realm to the child’s christening, so that each might offer a gift of protection and fortune.

On the day of the celebration, the great hall shimmered with magic and light. One by one, the good fairies stepped forward to give their blessings—beauty, kindness, and grace beyond measure.

Then the air darkened.

The doors opened, and **Maleficent**, the wicked fairy of the mountains, entered in silence. She had not been invited, and she took the slight as an insult that could not be forgiven.

With a cold voice, she pronounced her curse:

> On the princess’s sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel and fall into a sleep like death.

Before despair could spread, the youngest good fairy rose. She could not undo Maleficent’s magic, but she reshaped it with her own.

> The princess will not die. Instead, she will **GO TO SLEEP** for one hundred years, and at the proper time, she will awaken again.

Fearful of the curse, the king ordered every spinning wheel destroyed. Years passed, and the kingdom lived on, watchful but hopeful.

On the day the princess turned sixteen, she wandered through a forgotten stairway into a high tower of the castle. There, hidden from sight, a spinning wheel waited. Drawn by curiosity, she touched it. The spindle pricked her finger.

At once, she fell into a deep sleep.

The king and queen hurried to her, stricken with grief. Word spread quickly through the castle and into the town beyond. People gathered, whispered, and worried. Night after night, they remained awake, watching the hours pass, hoping that vigilance alone might change what had already been set in motion.

Then the good fairy returned.

She did not argue with grief, nor did she command anyone to be calm. She knew the princess was safe, and she knew that the long waiting ahead did not require endless watching.

So she lifted her wand and spoke a blessing meant not to stop concern, but to ease it.

> While the princess sleeps, the kingdom itself shall rest as well.

The king and queen gently **CLOSE THEIR EYES**. The courtiers settled where they stood. Guards leaned against their spears. In the kitchens, hands stilled, and in the town beyond, people sank into quiet stillness.

As the fairy intended, they **GO TO SLEEP**, and as they slept they **FORGET ALL WORRIES**, for there was nothing that needed their attention while time quietly moved forward.

Dogs slept by the hearth. Horses rested in their stalls. Fires dimmed without going out. The entire kingdom slept, kept safe from sorrow and needless concern.

Around the castle, a thick forest of thorns rose up, hiding it from the world until the proper hour.

Years passed. Stories were told of a sleeping kingdom sealed away by magic and guarded by time itself. Princes came and went, but none could pass the thorns.

At last, when a hundred years had passed, a prince arrived who heard the story and felt drawn to the silent castle. As he approached, the thorns parted before him. He walked through the sleeping halls until he reached the tower.

There lay the princess.

At the moment foretold, the spell released its hold. The princess awakened.

At the same instant, throughout the castle and the town beyond, the kingdom stirred. The king and queen awoke. The people rose. Fires flared again, meals finished cooking, and all across the land people **FEEL REFRESHED**, as though they had rested exactly as long as they needed.

They saw the princess safe and well and knew that all would **BE OK**.

The prince and princess were married, and the kingdom prospered once more—having passed the long waiting in peace, and awakened only when it was truly time.
