# Questions for Bill O'Hanlon

## Bill O'Hanlon

1. Do you think Solution-Oriented Hypnosis reflects what Erickson was
   doing with most of his clients, or was he more direct than people
   often assume? Can you describe the difference between direct and
   indirect hypnosis?
	 This question is because his main approach is called
	 "Solution-Oriented Hypnosis" and it's very passive and indirect. So
	 it would be good to maybe ask him to explain this approach and
	 perhaps as a contrast to more direct approaches to hypnosis. We
	 basically give no suggestions, we don't tell them what to think or
	 feel or what they will experience, but purely give them options on
	 what they might, could, or can experience.

2. Could you walk us through how you identify the "Class of Problems" in
   a session, and how that points you toward a matching "Class of Solution?"
	 This is the main way that O'Hanlon handles problems and comes up with
	 solutions in hypnotherapy. The belief behind it is that clients
	 already have the skills and resources to solve their problems and
	 that what we do as hypnotherapists is provide the climate they need
	 to find those resources.

3. How did Erickson's idea of utilzing symptoms influence your own way
   of finding solutions in trance work?
   Utilization was a major contribution that Erickson gave to
	 hypnotherapy and O'Hanlon presents ways to utilize symptoms in many
	 different ways.

4. If client presents with multiple phobias and physical pain but one
   clear strength; like the ability to avoid sweets through fear of
   consequences, how would you use Solution-Oriented hypnosis to help
   her move from avoidance to choice?
Full Case Study below if he thinks the question lacks enough context:
	 Maria (not real name) is a 65 year old woman
   with multiple phobias, anxiety, diabetes, arthritis in her knee, and
	 insomnia.
   After interviewing her I found that her strength is that she can
   avoid sweets. This is likely due to her fear that it will negatively
   affect her diabetes. Fear seems to drive her to stop doing things.
   She even has a fear of driving and hasn't driven herself anywhere in
   a year.
   Her primary goal is to be able to walk without pain in her knee
	 because she believes this will help her overall health. After
   the first session with her I gave her the assignment to notice what
   choices she can make in her daily life. I also gave her a hypnosis
   session with stories that focused on making choices. She experienced
   significant insight that she could make more choices in her life and
   was not stuck. But the next day things "went back to normal" and she
   had the same fears and phobias she previously had.
	 This is a real case I'm struggling with and would like some help.

## Richard Hill

1. Can you describe the Mirroring Hands Technique and the theory
   behind it?
	 Hill is most well known for his book with Ernest Rossi called
	 "Mirroring Hands" which is one of the best Ericksonian techniques in
	 the world of hypnosis. It's often imitated by others but Hill will
	 show us the original technique. He is also the creator of the
	 "curiosity approach" which is an approach to therapy where you become
	 curios about the client and allow the curiosity to lead where the
	 session goes.

2. When people use Mirroring Hands, how do you see the balance between
   direct techniques and a permissive, indirect approach?
	 My understanding is that Rossi was very indirect and never told
	 clients what to expect, or what to do in the session. They were
	 basically finding out together. This leads into his "curiosity
	 approach" I mention in the last question.

3. Can you explain your Winner-Loser World Theory and how it helps us
   understand stress and anxiety?
	 Please feel free to introduce this question by mentioning that the
	 majority of problems people complained about in your survey was
	 anxiety. Richard is an expert in dealing with anxeity using
	 Ericksonian techniques so I'd like to hear how he handles it in a
	 client.

4. How does your "Curiosity Approach" relate to "Mirroring Hands?"
   Likely Richard will discuss his "Curiosity Approach" when he
   describes his Winner-Loser World Theory because it is the antidote to
   anxiety in the world theory. But just prepare to use this question as
   a follow up if he doesn't mention it.
