## Scope and Expectations

- This is a *primary goal* centered on improving sleep continuity and ease of sleep onset.
- Health and energy improvements are considered natural secondary effects, not treatment targets.
- The client understands change may stabilize over several sessions, depending on approach and individual response.

## Session Guidelines

- Treat each session as **standalone** — aim for direct improvement in sleep within that session.
- No need to coordinate with other practitioners; the goal statement remains identical for all.
- The client will evaluate outcomes based on **sleep quality over the following nights**, not trance depth or style.
