        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <hr />
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Sit back from the camera so I can see more of you all the way back,
            so I can see your hands and where they are resting comfortably.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adjust the way you are sitting if it makes you feel more
            comfortable. And take a deep breath... and let it out.
            That's right.
          </p>
          This is going to be kind of like a prototype of an actual hypnosis
          session, where for the next couple of minutes, I’ll give you a few
          verbal suggestions, and we’ll simply notice how your mind naturally
          creates focus.
          <br /><br />
          There’s nothing you need to do just let the words guide your attention
          and observe what happens.

        <h2>Concentration Exercise 1: Turning Attention Inward</h2>
        <div class="purpose">
          Purpose: To begin the process of directing awareness inward, exploring
          the internal world rather than the external one.
        </div>
        <hr />
        <blockquote>
          Let’s begin with something very simple. Go ahead and let your eyes
          close for a moment, and just allow your attention to turn inward.
          <br /><br />
          You don’t have to make anything happen, just notice what it’s like to
          bring your attention inward, away from what’s happening around you,
          and into your own inner experience.
          <br /><br />
          When you’re ready, you can bring yourself back and we’ll have a little

        <h2>
          Concentration Exercise 2: Awareness of Breathing and Bodily Sensations
        </h2>
        <div class="purpose">
          Purpose: To help the subject notice unconscious bodily rhythms and
          sensations while strengthening inward focus through sensory yes-sets.
        </div>
        <hr />
        <blockquote>
          For this next little exercise, go ahead and close your eyes again.
          <br /><br />
          You might notice your chest filling with air, and how the air moves
          all the way down toward your stomach. And just allow your attention to
          rest there for a few moments.
          <br /><br />
          You may notice the gentle rhythm of your breathing, the way your body
          moves as the air flows in and out, and how easy it is to simply
          observe it happening all by itself.
          <br /><br />
          And as you notice that, you may become aware of something else your
          body is doing — maybe the sense of warmth where your body touches the
          chair, or a feeling of heaviness in your hands or feet, or a stillness
          somewhere inside.
          <br /><br />
          You don’t have to say anything just yet — just notice what’s happening
          inside, the natural rhythm of your own body and mind.
          <br /><br />
          When you’re ready, you can bring yourself back and we’ll have a little
          chat about what you experienced.

        <h2>Concentration Exercise 3: Floating Sensation and Arm Response</h2>
        <div class="purpose">
          Purpose: To invite spontaneous physical responsiveness and prepare for
          arm levitation convincer through automatic movement.
        </div>
        <hr />
        <blockquote>
          Now let’s explore something new. Go ahead and close your eyes once
          again. And as you take a comfortable breath, imagine that each breath
          allows your awareness to drift more deeply inward.
          <br /><br />
          You might begin to notice subtle sensations in your arms or hands —
          perhaps one arm feels a little lighter, or a little different than the
          other. You don’t have to choose which one; simply notice.
          <br /><br />
          And as you continue to notice that lighter feeling, you might find
          that the arm that feels lighter begins to respond all by itself —
          maybe a small twitch, a gentle shift, or even a sense that it wants to
          rise, just a little.
          <br /><br />
          There’s no need to help it — simply notice if that lighter arm begins
          to lift, as though something inside is doing it for you. Just letting
          it happen, easily and naturally.
          <br /><br />
          And when it’s ready, you can allow that arm to drift back down again,
          resting comfortably once more.
          <br /><br />
          When you’re ready, you can bring yourself back and we’ll have a little
          chat about what you experienced.

        <h2>Transition: Arm Levitation Convincer</h2>
        <div class="purpose">
          This sequence leads naturally into a full arm-levitation convincer.
        </div>
        <hr />
        <blockquote>
          You did great with that. Let’s take that same feeling a little
          further. Go ahead and close your eyes again. As you breathe
          comfortably, you might begin to notice that same lightness returning
          to one of your hands… perhaps even more strongly this time.
          <br /><br />
          Imagine that a gentle force — like a thread, or a balloon — is
          attached to the back of that hand, and it begins to lift… just a
          little at first. Notice how it happens on its own, as if your hand is
          remembering how to float.
          <br /><br />
          That’s it… just allowing whatever happens to happen. And when your
          hand has gone as high as it wants to go, you can let it drift back
          down, feeling relaxed and comfortable.
          <br /><br />
          When you’re ready, you can bring yourself back and we’ll have a little
          chat about what you experienced.

        <h2>Transition to Formal Trance</h2>
        <div class="purpose">
          Purpose: To summarize the exercises, create a gentle yes‑set, and
          bridge into a full hypnotic induction.
        </div>
        <hr />
        <blockquote>
          You’ve done beautifully with these exercises — each one showing how
          easily your attention can turn inward.
          <br /><br />
          You’ve noticed how your breathing changes, how your body relaxes, and
          even how your hands can respond all by themselves.
          <br /><br />
          Would you say that each time you’ve gone inward, it’s become a little
          easier?
          <br /><br />
          (They respond.)
          <br /><br />
          Good. And you’ve enjoyed that sense of curiosity and calm, haven’t
          you?
          <br /><br />
          (They respond.)
          <br /><br />
          Wonderful. Because in a moment, we can take that same comfortable
          inward focus and let it deepen — into a more complete, formal trance
          experience. All you’ll need to do is sit comfortably, close your eyes
          again, and allow that same process to continue even more deeply.
