    <h2>One-line summary</h2>
    <div class="card summary"><strong>“That’s right” = Notice a helpful change → acknowledge it → invite the next small step.</strong></div>

    <h2>Practice drills (5–10 minutes)</h2>
    <p><em>From <strong>The Deep Trance Training Manual</strong> by Igor Ledochowski</em></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Ask your partner to put themselves in a trance.</strong> Allow them to close their eyes or self-induce in their own comfortable way.</li>
      <li><strong>Once they’re in trance, Spot &amp; Mark:</strong> Observe your partner’s micro-signs for 60–90 seconds. Only say “That’s right” when something changes.</li>
      <li><strong>Once they’re in trance, Breath-sync:</strong> Time “That’s right” to their <em>exhale</em> for two minutes.</li>
      <li><strong>Once they’re in trance, Link-forward:</strong> After “That’s right,” add a soft bridge: “and…” + gentle direction. Keep it under 7 words.<br/>
        <em>Examples:</em> “and you might notice your breathing continue to slow,” “and that comfort can spread a little further,” “and you may start to drift even deeper.”
      </li>
    </ol>

    <div class="card tip">
      <p><em>A quick, plain-language guide you can read or keep beside your scripts.</em></p>
    </div>

    <h2>What it means (in simple terms)</h2>
    <p><strong>“That’s right”</strong> is a gentle acknowledgment. You’re telling the person, “What you’re doing now is good. Keep going.” It’s not a command. It’s a warm green light.</p>

    <h2>Why it works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reinforces helpful responses (heteroaction):</strong> When they sigh, breathe deeper, or settle, you softly mark it with “That’s right,” and the body-mind continues in the same direction.</li>
      <li><strong>Marks trance signs (trance analogues):</strong> Eye flutters, slower blinking, stillness, facial softening — “That’s right” tells the unconscious these shifts are welcome.</li>
      <li><strong>Builds safety and flow:</strong> It validates experience without pushing. The session feels natural, permissive, and smooth.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="card"><em>Think of it as a verbal nod. You notice something good; you nod; they continue.</em></div>

    <h2>When to say it</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>After any <strong>spontaneous, useful change</strong> (a deeper exhale, eyelids heavier, settling posture).</li>
      <li>Right after they <strong>follow</strong> a suggestion (they close their eyes, count down, imagine a scene).</li>
      <li>When you want to <strong>bridge</strong> from pacing to a next step.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to say it</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tone:</strong> Warm, low, unhurried.</li>
      <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Immediately after the helpful sign.</li>
      <li><strong>Pacing:</strong> Let a micro-pause come <em>before</em> it so it lands.</li>
      <li><strong>Volume:</strong> Slightly softer than surrounding words.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="card"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Let the breath out as you say it. Your exhale invites their exhale.</div>

    <h2>Voice qualities for “That’s right”</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tone:</strong> Warm, approving, and permissive — as if gently confirming something that’s already happening.</li>
      <li><strong>Pitch:</strong> Let it fall slightly on the word <em>right</em> to convey calm certainty. Avoid upward or questioning tones.</li>
      <li><strong>Rhythm:</strong> Match your partner’s tempo or breathing. Say it on their exhale if possible. Include a small pause before and after.</li>
      <li><strong>Volume:</strong> Softer than surrounding words — about half-volume, not a whisper. Whisper only if it feels natural and the environment allows intimacy.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="card summary">Lower pitch + slower rhythm + soft volume + warm tone = hypnotic pacing.</div>

    <h2>Adapting your voice through the session</h2>
    <p>At the start, during conversation or suggestibility tests, your voice can be <strong>brighter, faster, and more animated</strong> to match the person’s alert state and build rapport. In these moments, saying <strong>“That’s right!”</strong> with light enthusiasm can pace and lead them toward a feeling of <strong>energy, interest, and confidence</strong> about the process.</p>
    <p>This early excitement helps replace uncertainty with engagement and readiness. As trance responses appear, gradually <strong>slow your rhythm, lower your pitch, and soften your tone</strong> so that “That’s right” becomes a gentle, validating marker.</p>
    <p>The shift from lively pacing to calm guiding mirrors the subject’s journey — you begin <em>where they are</em> and naturally lead them <em>where they’re going.</em></p>

    <h2>Example uses (plug-and-play)</h2>
    <div class="examples">
      <p><strong>Induction (pacing → leading):</strong> “Noticing the simple rhythm of your breathing… <em>that’s right…</em> and with each exhale, comfort can spread a little more.”</p>
      <p><strong>Deepening (mark a sign, link it forward):</strong> “As the eyelids get just a bit heavier… <em>that’s right…</em> and with that, drifting down another level now.”</p>
      <p><strong>Imagery/therapy:</strong> “As you picture that calmer scene beginning to form… <em>that’s right…</em> and you can allow the feeling that comes with it to settle in.”</p>
      <p><strong>Utilizing a spontaneous response (heteroaction):</strong> “There’s that longer breath… <em>that’s right…</em> your system knows exactly how to continue.”</p>
      <p><strong>Pacing resistance:</strong> “You don’t have to go any faster than you’re going… <em>that’s right…</em> just letting it unfold in the way that’s most comfortable for you.”</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Common mistakes (and quick fixes)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mechanical or too often:</strong> Use it selectively at meaningful moments. Let silence do the rest.</li>
      <li><strong>Forcing progress:</strong> Keep it non-directive. You’re validating, not pushing.</li>
      <li><strong>Flat or rushed delivery:</strong> Slow down. Drop your voice slightly. Allow a micro-pause before/after.</li>
      <li><strong>Premature marking:</strong> Notice → Pause → “That’s right.” → Link forward.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A tiny formula you can memorize</h2>
    <p><strong>Notice</strong> the useful sign → <strong>Acknowledge</strong> it (“That’s right…”) → <strong>Link</strong> it to the next gentle direction.</p>

    <h2>Mini-scripts you can drop into sessions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>“And as your attention naturally turns inward… <strong>that’s right</strong>… allowing comfort to grow.”</li>
      <li>“Feeling the shoulders lower just a touch… <strong>that’s right</strong>… and with that, more ease arrives.”</li>
      <li>“Even if part of you is just curious… <strong>that’s right</strong>… curiosity can open space for change.”</li>
      <li>“You don’t have to make anything happen… <strong>that’s right</strong>… simply letting what’s already happening continue.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>They look “stuck”:</strong> Mark any subtle analogue (a blink, stillness). “There… <strong>that’s right</strong>… noticing even that tiny shift is enough.”</li>
      <li><strong>They open their eyes or fidget:</strong> Normalize and utilize. “Wandering is natural… <strong>that’s right</strong>… and as you settle again, the next breath can take you deeper inside.”</li>
      <li><strong>You feel unsure what to say:</strong> Quietly watch and wait for the next analogue, then mark it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ethical note</h2>
    <p>Use “That’s right” to support autonomy. It validates their experience. Avoid using it to override boundaries or push an agenda.</p>
