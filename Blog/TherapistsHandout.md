# When to Refer a Client for Hypnotherapy
**Professional Reference for Therapists**

---

### Purpose
This handout clarifies when a client’s problem is better addressed through **hypnosis** rather than continued **talk-based psychotherapy**.
It is designed to help licensed therapists determine when to refer a client for hypnotherapy as a complementary or alternative approach.

### The Key Difference

Psychotherapy and hypnotherapy both aim to create positive change, but they do so in different ways.

- **Psychotherapy** focuses on changing understanding, perspective, and meaning. It works through discussion, reflection, and insight — helping clients gain awareness and make conscious decisions.
- **Hypnotherapy** focuses on changing automatic responses and conditioned reactions. It works through focused attention and unconscious learning — helping clients update habits and emotional patterns that operate outside conscious control.
- In short, psychotherapy helps change how a person *thinks* about the problem, while hypnosis helps change how they *automatically respond* to it.

### When Referral Is Appropriate

Refer to hypnotherapy when the client’s symptoms are:
- **Automatic, habitual, or reflexive**
- **Persisting despite insight or cognitive understanding**
- **Emotionally or physiologically driven** rather than logical
- **Reinforced by body memory or conditioned response**

Typical phrases that indicate suitability:
- “I understand it, but I still react the same way.”
- “I know it’s irrational, but I can’t stop.”
- “It just happens automatically.”
- “I keep talking about it, but nothing changes.”

### Common Issues Suited for Hypnotherapy

**Anxiety & Stress Response**
- Panic, tension, or restlessness not relieved by reasoning
- Overactive startle or fear reactions

**Habits & Compulsions**
- Nail biting, smoking, overeating, skin picking, procrastination

**Somatic and Psychophysiological Symptoms**
- Chronic pain or tension that worsens under stress
- Functional disorders (e.g., IBS, TMJ, bruxism)

**Sleep and Rest Regulation**
- Difficulty falling asleep or quieting the mind
- Nighttime rumination or early-morning waking

**Performance & Confidence**
- Test anxiety, public speaking fears, creative blocks

**Residual Trauma Responses**
- Emotional overreactions after trauma has been processed
- Persistent physiological activation despite therapy progress

### When to Continue or Prioritize Psychotherapy

- Unstable mood or unsafe behavior patterns
- Active psychosis or untreated substance use
- When meaning-making, relationship work, or cognitive restructuring are primary goals

### Framing the Referral for Clients

You might say:
> “We’ve done a lot of good work helping you understand this pattern. Hypnotherapy could help retrain the automatic part of your mind that’s still holding the old reaction. It’s a way to align what you consciously want with how your body and emotions respond.”

---

### Summary Statement

> **Therapy changes understanding. Hypnosis changes automatic responses.**
> Refer when understanding is no longer the barrier to change.
