              “Hypnosis for most people is what they see on a stage show, where
              they see someone shout ‘SLEEP!’ and the person suddenly goes limp.
              But hypnosis isn’t actually sleep — it’s a
              <strong>heightened state of awareness and focus</strong>
              called trance.”
            </p>

            <p>
              “So when I say the word <strong>‘sleep’</strong>, I won’t be
              telling you to go to sleep. I’ll simply be guiding you into that
              <em>comfortable, relaxed, but focused state of awareness</em> that
              that you previously experienced.”
            </p>

            <p>
              “Would you believe me if I said that we’re experiencing trance
              most of the time?”

          <div class="section-body">
            <!-- A. Driving example now comes first -->
            <p>
              A. Raise your hand if you've ever been driving and realized you
              missed your exit because your mind drifted? — “Maybe you were
              listening to the radio or daydreaming a little. You’re still aware
              of what’s going on on the road, but just enough of your attention
              is on something else that you miss your exit.”
            </p>

            <!-- Insert Erickson quote and yes-set -->
            <p>
              You know who Milton Erickson is, right?
              <br />
              (nods softly)
              <br />
              He once said, <em>“Trance is a natural everyday experience.”</em>
              <br />
              (soft nod continues)
              <br />
              That’s right… let me give you another example.
            </p>

            <!-- B. Window question follows -->
            <p>
              B. What happens when I ask you, “How many windows are in your
              house?” — “Notice how you have to
              <strong><em>go inside your imagination</em></strong> to count each
              window in the house while another part stays here listening. That
              natural shift of focus is the same kind of experience we use in
              hypnosis.”
            </p>

            <!-- C. New Movie Theater metaphor -->
            <p>
              C. Raise your hand if you’ve ever gone to the movies in the
              afternoon—bright daylight when you walk in—and when you come out
              it’s pitch-black night. — “It’s funny, isn’t it? For a moment you
              almost forget how much time has gone by. That’s hypnosis, because
              you were so engaged in that story—so focused on what was happening
              on the screen—that the rest of the world just faded out for a
              while.”
            </p>

            <!-- D. Remaining metaphors renumbered accordingly -->
            <p>
              D. Have you ever been so absorbed in a book or movie that you lost
              track of time? — “That absorption is similar to how trance feels.”
            </p>

            <p>
              E. Have you ever caught yourself daydreaming and noticed the world
              fading into the background? — “That gentle drifting is the same
              kind of experience we use in hypnosis.”
            </p>

            <p>
              F. Have you ever listened to music so deeply that everything else
              seemed to disappear? — “That focused absorption is perfect for
              this process.”
            </p>

            <p>
              G. Have you ever found yourself in the zone while walking or
              exercising, where your body moves almost automatically? — “That
              comfortable rhythm is the same kind of focus we’ll use now.”
            </p>

            <p>
              H. Have you noticed those moments just before sleep when thoughts
              wander and images appear on their own? — “Hypnosis is like that
              in-between state — aware, yet pleasantly absorbed.”
            </p>

            <p>
              I. Have you ever been so engaged in a conversation or hobby that
              time seemed to fly by? — “That natural time-distortion is common
              in trance as well.”

              I have one more very interesting example that you should find fun
              to imagine, but for this I'll ask you to close your eyes for just
              a moment...
            </p>

            <p>
              Imagine that a good friend has given you a fresh lemon from their
              tree... in fact! it still has the stem on it! It's a beautiful,
              bright yellow lemon with a nice, shiny skin, and it's actually
              such a big lemon that it takes two hands to hold it. You can feel
              the skin on the lemon between your hands and just to find out what
              happens imagine holding it up to your nose and smelling it? What
              happens?
            </p>

            <p>
              (wait for response — this gauges how they respond to sensory
              suggestions)
            </p>

            <p>
              Now let's take this lemon to your kitchen and get out a cutting
              board. Put it on the cutting board and imagine cutting it in half.
              Notice all the juices coming out of this lemon! Now... hold one
              half of the lemon up to your mouth and take a big bite out of it
              and tell me what you notice... that's right.
            </p>

            <p>
              Just take a moment to appreciate that experience and when you're
              ready just bring yourself back and we'll have a little chat about
              it.

              “There are usually three—no, actually four—common concerns that
              people have about hypnosis.”
            </p>

            <p>
              “The first is about sleep — and we already talked about that.
              Hypnosis isn’t sleep, it’s that focused, aware state we practiced
              earlier.”
            </p>

            <p>
              “The second is, ‘What if I get stuck inside and can’t get out?’ —
              but you already proved to yourself with the lemon experience that
              you can come back easily and naturally anytime you choose.”
            </p>

            <p>
              “And sometimes people ask, ‘What if I reveal something I don’t
              mean to say or do something I don’t want to do?’ The mind has a
              built-in filter called the
              <strong>critical faculty</strong>. It’s like a gate that keeps
              anything from going in or out that you don’t want. You hold the
              key, so you’ll never say or do anything that goes against your
              values or intentions. Does that make sense? ” (nod head)
