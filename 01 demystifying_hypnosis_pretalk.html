<!-- Pretalk Intro -->
<div class="section-title">Pretalk</div>
<div class="card"><div class="q">Start here: prior experience</div><div class="link">“Have you ever been hypnotized before?”</div><div class="link">If yes: “How was that experience for you?” (Listen. Note preconceptions, positives, concerns.)</div><div class="link">If no: “Great — we’ll keep it simple and natural. I’ll guide you step‑by‑step.”</div></div><div class="card">
<div class="q">Intro you can read verbatim</div>
<div class="link">“Hypnosis for most people is what they see on a stage show, where they see someone say ‘SLEEP!’ and then they go to sleep, but hypnosis isn’t sleep, it’s a heightened state of focus called a trance. And we’re in a trance most of the time. For example…”</div>
</div>
<!-- Metaphor Openers -->
<div class="section-title">Metaphor Openers</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="q">How many windows are in your house?</div>
<div class="link">“As you picture each one, your mind drifts naturally into imagination — the same kind of focus that makes hypnosis so effective.”</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="q">Have you ever been driving and realized you missed your exit because your mind drifted?</div>
<div class="link">“That’s the same kind of natural focus your mind uses in hypnosis.”</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="q">Have you ever been so absorbed in a book or movie that you lost track of time?</div>
<div class="link">“That absorption is similar to how trance feels.”</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="q">Have you ever caught yourself daydreaming and noticed the world fading into the background?</div>
<div class="link">“That gentle drifting is the same kind of experience we use in hypnosis.”</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="q">Have you ever listened to music so deeply that everything else seemed to disappear?</div>
<div class="link">“That focused absorption is perfect for this process.”</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="q">Have you ever found yourself in the zone while walking or exercising, where your body moves almost automatically?</div>
<div class="link">“That comfortable rhythm is the same kind of focus we’ll use now.”</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="q">Have you noticed those moments just before sleep when thoughts wander and images appear on their own?</div>
<div class="link">“Hypnosis is like that in‑between state — aware, yet pleasantly absorbed.”</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="q">Have you ever been so engaged in a conversation or hobby that time seemed to fly by?</div>
<div class="link">“That natural time‑distortion is common in trance as well.”</div>
</div>
<div class="card tips">
<div><strong>Bridge into Induction Example:</strong> “Yes? Great — that’s exactly the kind of focus your mind can enjoy right now, <em>and</em> as you notice your breathing, you can just let your eyes close… and begin to relax more deeply.”</div>
</div>
<!-- Addressing Concerns -->
<div class="section-title">Addressing Common Concerns</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="q">There are usually three common concerns people have about hypnosis that I hope to clarify first.</div>
<div class="link">Use a calm, factual tone. Normalize each question before you reassure.</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="q">“What if I get stuck inside and can’t get out?”</div>
<div class="link">“Hypnosis is a state of focus — not sleep. You remain aware, and you can open your eyes or move anytime you wish.”</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="q">“What if I reveal secrets while in hypnosis?”</div>
<div class="link">“You stay in control of what you say. Your mind protects your privacy the same way it does in normal conversation.”</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="q">“What if I do something silly or weird?”</div>
<div class="link">“In therapeutic hypnosis, you’re always in charge of your behavior. The process simply helps your mind respond more easily to positive suggestions.”</div>
</div>
<div class="card"><div class="q">Lemon imagination exercise (before Q&amp;A)</div><div class="link">“If you like, you can close your eyes. Picture a fresh lemon on a cutting board — notice the bright skin and the weight in your hand.”</div><div class="link">“Imagine slicing it open… hear the knife, see the juice bead up and catch the scent as it lifts.”</div><div class="link">“Bring a wedge to your lips and imagine the sharp, sour taste. Notice what your mouth is doing now.”</div></div><div class="card tips"><div><strong>Why this works:</strong> It primes vivid sensory imagination and natural body responses, making later suggestions easier.</div></div><div class="card tips">
<div><strong>Invite Questions:</strong> “Do you have any questions about hypnosis?”</div>
</div><div class="section-title">Outcome &amp; Focus for Today</div><div class="card"><div class="q">Outcome question (ask briefly, listen fully)</div><div class="link">“Wonderful. Now that you know what hypnosis really is, what would you like to get out of today’s experience?”</div><div class="link">“It could be something to improve, feel more confident about, or a habit you’d like to change.”</div></div><div class="card tips"><div><strong>Reflect and prime:</strong> Briefly echo their words in positive terms (e.g., “So you’d like to feel calm and focused more often — excellent.”) Then bridge to induction.</div></div>
<!-- Transition to Induction -->
<div class="card tips"><div><strong>Answer questions now:</strong> Invite and address any remaining questions before the concentration exercise. Keep responses brief, reassuring, and oriented to their goal.</div></div><div class="section-title">Transition to Induction</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="q">Chosen invitation</div>
<div class="link">“We can do a simple exercise — not a test or a challenge, just a way to notice how your mind naturally creates focus.”</div>
</div>
<p class="footer">Tip: One metaphor is usually enough. If it doesn’t land, try a different one — then bridge with <em>and</em>.</p>
