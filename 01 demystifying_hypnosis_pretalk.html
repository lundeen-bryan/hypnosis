          <p>A. How many windows are in your house? — “As you picture each one, your mind drifts naturally into imagination — the same kind of focus that makes hypnosis so effective.”</p>
          <p>B. Have you ever been driving and realized you missed your exit because your mind drifted? — “That’s the same kind of natural focus your mind uses in hypnosis.”</p>
          <p>C. Have you ever been so absorbed in a book or movie that you lost track of time? — “That absorption is similar to how trance feels.”</p>
          <p>D. Have you ever caught yourself daydreaming and noticed the world fading into the background? — “That gentle drifting is the same kind of experience we use in hypnosis.”</p>
          <p>E. Have you ever listened to music so deeply that everything else seemed to disappear? — “That focused absorption is perfect for this process.”</p>
          <p>F. Have you ever found yourself in the zone while walking or exercising, where your body moves almost automatically? — “That comfortable rhythm is the same kind of focus we’ll use now.”</p>
          <p>G. Have you noticed those moments just before sleep when thoughts wander and images appear on their own? — “Hypnosis is like that in‑between state — aware, yet pleasantly absorbed.”</p>
          <p>H. Have you ever been so engaged in a conversation or hobby that time seemed to fly by? — “That natural time‑distortion is common in trance as well.”</p>

        <div class="section-body">
          <p>There are usually three common concerns (besides sleep) people have about hypnosis that I hope to clarify first.</p>
          <p>• “What if I get stuck inside and can’t get out?”</p>
          <p>• “What if I reveal secrets while in hypnosis?”</p>

      <details class="card">
        <summary><span class="chev">▶</span><span>VII. Outcome question</span></summary>
        <div class="section-body">
          <p>“Wonderful. Now that you know what hypnosis really is, what would you like to get out of today’s experience?”</p>
          <p>“It could be something to improve, feel more confident about, or a habit you’d like to change.”</p>
          <p>Reflect and prime: Briefly echo their words in positive terms (e.g., “So you’d like to feel calm and focused more often — excellent.”) Then bridge to induction.</p>
          <p>Answer questions now: Invite and address any remaining questions before the concentration exercise. Keep responses brief, reassuring, and oriented to their goal.</p>

        <summary><span class="chev">▶</span><span>VIII. Seating Properly</span></summary>
        <div class="section-body">
          <p>Sit back from the camera so I can see more of you all the way back, so I can see your hands and where they are resting comfortably.</p>
          <p>We're going to continue these little exercises to help us get warmed up to hypnosis, so I'll ask you a few more questions. Is that okay?</p>
