      <h2>Concentration Experiment 1: Turning Attention Inward</h2>
      <div class="purpose">Purpose: To begin the process of directing awareness inward, exploring the internal world rather than the external one.</div>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
        Let‚Äôs begin with something very simple. Go ahead and let your eyes close for a moment, and just allow your attention to turn inward.
        <br/><br/>
        You don‚Äôt have to make anything happen, just notice what it‚Äôs like to bring your attention inward, away from what‚Äôs happening around you, and into your own inner experience.
        <br/><br/>
        When you‚Äôre ready, you can bring yourself back and we‚Äôll have a little chat about what you experienced.

      <h2>Concentration Experiment 2: Awareness of Breathing and Bodily Sensations</h2>
      <div class="purpose">Purpose: To help the subject notice unconscious bodily rhythms and sensations while strengthening inward focus through sensory yes-sets.</div>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
        For this next little experiment, go ahead and close your eyes again.
        <br/><br/>
        You might notice your chest filling with air, and how the air moves all the way down toward your stomach. And just allow your attention to rest there for a few moments.
        <br/><br/>
        You may notice the gentle rhythm of your breathing, the way your body moves as the air flows in and out, and how easy it is to simply observe it happening all by itself.
        <br/><br/>
        And as you notice that, you may become aware of something else your body is doing ‚Äî maybe the sense of warmth where your body touches the chair, or a feeling of heaviness in your hands or feet, or a stillness somewhere inside.
        <br/><br/>
        You don‚Äôt have to say anything just yet ‚Äî just notice what‚Äôs happening inside, the natural rhythm of your own body and mind.
        <br/><br/>

      <h2>Concentration Experiment 3: Floating Sensation and Arm Response</h2>
      <div class="purpose">Purpose: To invite spontaneous physical responsiveness and prepare for arm levitation convincer through automatic movement.</div>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
        Now let‚Äôs explore something new. Go ahead and close your eyes once again. And as you take a comfortable breath, imagine that each breath allows your awareness to drift more deeply inward.
        <br/><br/>
        You might begin to notice subtle sensations in your arms or hands ‚Äî perhaps one arm feels a little lighter, or a little different than the other. You don‚Äôt have to choose which one; simply notice.
        <br/><br/>
        And as you continue to notice that lighter feeling, you might find that the arm that feels lighter begins to respond all by itself ‚Äî maybe a small twitch, a gentle shift, or even a sense that it wants to rise, just a little.
        <br/><br/>
        There‚Äôs no need to help it ‚Äî simply notice if that lighter arm begins to lift, as though something inside is doing it for you. Just letting it happen, easily and naturally.
        <br/><br/>
        And when it‚Äôs ready, you can allow that arm to drift back down again, resting comfortably once more.
        <br/><br/>

      <h2>Transition: Arm Levitation Convincer</h2>
      <div class="purpose">This sequence leads naturally into a full arm-levitation convincer.</div>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
        You did great with that. Let‚Äôs take that same feeling a little further. Go ahead and close your eyes again. As you breathe comfortably, you might begin to notice that same lightness returning to one of your hands‚Ä¶ perhaps even more strongly this time.
        <br/><br/>
        Imagine that a gentle force ‚Äî like a thread, or a balloon ‚Äî is attached to the back of that hand, and it begins to lift‚Ä¶ just a little at first. Notice how it happens on its own, as if your hand is remembering how to float.
        <br/><br/>
        That‚Äôs it‚Ä¶ just allowing whatever happens to happen. And when your hand has gone as high as it wants to go, you can let it drift back down, feeling relaxed and comfortable.
        <br/><br/>
        When you‚Äôre ready, you can bring yourself back and we‚Äôll have a little chat about what you experienced.
